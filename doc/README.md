#Introduction
This documentation contains descriptions of all the major aspects of *Dungeon Cleaner*. The game features a [Grid](Grid.md) system, managed by [Levels](Level.md), which also manage the turns of every entity ([Player](Player.md), [Enemy](Enemy.md), etc.) contained in that level.

###Where do I start?
The best place to start if you're just getting to grips with the code is the [Level](Level.md) page, because all game entities are stored (sometimes indirectly) within levels.
